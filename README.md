GAIA is an AI-powered digital banking assistant designed to modernize and automate customer support across GCB’s digital platforms.

It enables customers to interact with banking services through simple natural language text messaging — making digital banking as easy as texting a friend.

## Overview

Customers today expect banking to be instant, intuitive, and accessible 24/7.

However, many still experience delays, confusion, and dependency on physical support channels.

GAIA solves this by embedding an intelligent assistant directly inside GCB’s digital ecosystem to provide real-time guidance, issue resolution, and secure transaction support.

## The Problem

GCB customers face several recurring challenges when using digital banking platforms:

### 1. Platform Delays and Support Friction
Customers encounter issues that slow down service delivery and reduce satisfaction.

### 2. Limited Awareness of Available Services
Many users are unaware of the full range of services offered digitally, leading to underutilization.

### 3. Overdependence on Physical Branches
Customers often visit branches for tasks that should be handled digitally, increasing operational strain.

### 4. Call Center Overload
Support lines become congested because customers rely heavily on manual assistance.

These processes remain largely manual — and it is time to automate them.
